        <h1>Stability Breeds Happiness</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p>
                The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) assigns
                "Happiness Scores" to 145 countries based on six factors: GDP per capita, Social
                support, Generosity, Freedom, Trust in Government, and Health. The
                Slopegraph below shows how these Happiness Scores have changed from
                2015 to 2017 for all tracked countries.<br><br>
                The data shows that the happiest countries in the rankings are
                the most stable. In this case, stable is defined as less than 2%
                change. See for yourself! Move the slider below so that
                it is measuring happiness changes of > 2%. You will notice that
                the top 10 or so countries remain gray while most of the countries below
                turn green or red. The data also shows that few countries have large changes
                in happiness and those that do can be pinned on current events
                in the country. For example, Venezuela's happiness score drastically
                decreased from 2015 to 2017. This can be linked to the economic
                turmoil and protests currently happening in the country due to
                decline of oil prices that started in late 2014.<br><br>
                To explore the data more, select a country from the buttons below
                or hover over the line of a country in the Slopegraph. Countries can be
                unselected by clicking on their name again or clicking
                the "Reset" button. Multiple countries can be selected at the
                same time. The year 2016 can be filtered by clicking on the "2016" button below.
                <br>
                The slider can be adjusted to choose the change in happiness levels.
                The legend is interactable so line symbols in the legend can be
                clicked to show all corresponding countries that experienced
                the chosen increase or decrease in happiness.
